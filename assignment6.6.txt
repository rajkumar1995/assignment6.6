1. Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler
 

fifo scheduler :
                they are placed in queue and runs them in the order of submission 
                they excecute task in first in first out manner
                the request of the first application available in the queue are allocated first then the next element wil served and so on
                the FIFO Scheduler has the merit of being simple to understand and not needing any configuration
                Large applications will use all the resources in a cluster, so each application has to wait its turn


capacity scheduler :
                   in capacity scheduler the shortest job that is being submitted will start rather than in fifo order
                   larger job will be given less priority to run hence shorter jobs are excecuted faster
                   This is at the cost of overall cluster utilization since the queue capacity is reserved for jobs in that queue
                   if queue is not designed properly then they will be overloaded or underutilized



2. What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x
    
 hadoop 1.x:
            job tracker keeps track of resource utilization and job monitoring.
            it will be suited for 4000 to 40000 tasks only
            it supports only mapreduce processing model
            task tracker is configured with static slots
            it has only single name node
            name node failure creates problem in hadoop 1.x

hadoop 2.x:
            resource utilization is taken care by resource manager and node manager
            it is suited for about 10000 to 100000 task
            resource are dynamic 
            it supports other models like processing models alomg with mapreduce
            it has multiple name node
            name node failure will not create problem since there are multiple name nodes being available
